    <h1>My New Journey: Learning to Code (and Cry a Little)</h1>

    <p>One fine Tuesday (I think it was a Tuesday), I stared at my to-do list and thought, “Why not make things harder by learning to code?”</p>

    <p>I went from “What’s a div?” to “Why is everything breaking and why do I smell burnt toast?” within the first 48 hours. Turns out HTML isn’t a disease (though it felt like one at first), CSS is both a blessing and a curse, and JavaScript... well, JavaScript is like that one friend who’s hilarious but always late and kind of unreliable.</p>

    <p>The first time I centered something with flexbox, I felt like a wizard. The second time, it didn’t work, and I questioned everything including my existence.</p>

    <p>Every success feels like climbing Everest. Every failure feels like falling down a manhole of error messages and emotional instability. But somehow, I love it.</p>

    <p>This blog is where I document all the triumphs, facepalms, accidental infinite loops, and weird moments where I finally understand how <code>async/await</code> works (until I forget again).</p>

    <p>If you’re on a similar journey, welcome. May your bugs be shallow, your commits be meaningful, and your caffeine supply never run dry.</p>
