    <h1>How I Broke My Code (and My Spirit)</h1>
    <p>I mistook a semicolon for a life decision. Debugging my code and my choices now.</p>
    <p>Turns out, JavaScript is not forgiving when it comes to accidental punctuation. One rogue `;` had me spiraling faster than a while loop with no exit condition. My IDE crashed, and so did my emotional stability.</p>
    <p>Note to self: semicolons are not optional for your sanity.</p>
    <p>It started innocently. A late-night coding session. A playlist titled “Focus Mode.” A fresh cup of overconfidence.</p>

    <p>I was writing a function to calculate something — I don’t remember what, I blacked out emotionally around line 43. But one misplaced semicolon turned my entire program into a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a Stack Overflow post.</p>

    <p>I yelled at my screen, then apologized to it. I even offered it snacks if it would just compile. No luck.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I found the problem: a single, sneaky semicolon that ended a line prematurely, like a mic drop from a rogue punctuation mark. It said, “I’m done,” and so was my will to code.</p>

    <p>Lesson learned: Code is precise. Your soul? Not so much.</p>

    <p>PS: The function works now. So does my coping mechanism: memes and deep breaths.</p>
