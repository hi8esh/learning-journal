            <h1>Who am I? Well... I'm Still Figuring That Out.</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I'm a wannabe coder, accidental philosopher, and self-proclaimed meme connoisseur. I started this journey because my life was filled with a lot of existential dread and not enough semicolons. So, I swapped late-night existential crises for debugging sessions. And honestly, it's been a wild ride.</p>
            <h2>My Story (or How I Got Into Coding... Kind of)</h2>
            <p>It all started with a single Google search: "How to make a website that looks cooler than my social media." Little did I know that would lead me into the never-ending world of JavaScript errors, CSS headaches, and the occasional emotional breakdown. But hey, I’m still here and I haven’t broken the internet yet (not for lack of trying).</p>
            <h2>What Do I Actually Do?</h2>
            <p>I’m in the process of learning to code and trying to make sense of the madness. I mostly write JavaScript, break a lot of things (including my will to live), and occasionally remember to use <code>console.log()</code> to debug. I'm also here to share my experiences with anyone else who feels like their brain is made of spaghetti code.</p>
            <h2>My Current Goals:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Master JavaScript without questioning my life choices (no promises).</li>
                <li>Understand why CSS hates me — and why flexbox seems like a cruel joke.</li>
                <li>Build a website that doesn’t crash when I try to push it to GitHub.</li>
                <li>Not give up and become a professional napper instead.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
            <p>This blog is my place to share my coding journey, my mistakes (because there are plenty), and my small victories (like the time I got a <code>console.log()</code> to actually work). If you're here, you're either a fellow developer looking for solace, or a friend trying to understand why I spend 80% of my time staring at a screen. Either way, welcome!</p>
            <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I once spent three hours debugging a problem, only to realize I had forgotten a semicolon.</li>
                <li>I can’t center a div, but I can definitely center my thoughts on the existential crisis of being a developer.</li>
                <li>My idea of a "quick break" is watching five episodes of a coding tutorial and then wondering why it's midnight.</li>
            </ul>
