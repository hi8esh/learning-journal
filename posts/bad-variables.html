    <h1>Variables & Very Bad Decisions</h1>
    <p>I named it <code>x</code>. Then forgot what <code>x</code> meant. Now it's Schrodinger's variable.</p>
    <p>I thought I was being clever. Concise. Efficient. Instead, I created a digital enigma. By hour three, I had six <code>x</code>s doing six different things, and none of them remembered who they were anymore. Me neither.</p>
    <p>Next time, I'll name it <code>regretLevelOver9000</code> — at least it'll be honest.</p>
    <p>They told me to use meaningful variable names. I did. I called it <code>thing</code>. Then <code>anotherThing</code>. Then <code>lolIDK</code>.</p>

    <p>By the end of the function, I had created a miniature soap opera. <code>thing</code> was jealous of <code>anotherThing</code>. <code>lolIDK</code> was having an existential crisis. I just wanted to sort a list.</p>

    <p>I stared at the code like it was written by a stranger. A chaotic stranger. Who had no sense of naming conventions. Wait—it was me all along.</p>

    <p>Next time: variable names that make sense. Or at least a spreadsheet to decode them.</p>

    <p>Pro tip: If you’re naming your variable <code>x2ButBetter</code>, it’s already too late.</p>
