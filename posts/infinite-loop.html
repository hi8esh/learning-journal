  <h1>Loops Got Me Looping</h1>
  <p>I made an infinite loop. My code froze. My brain did too.</p>
  <p>Everything spiraled. The terminal screamed. The fan spun up like it was prepping for takeoff. I watched the screen as time lost meaning. I am become <code>while(true)</code>, destroyer of CPUs.</p>
  <p>I just wanted to loop through an array. Instead, I looped through my own bad decisions.</p>
  <p>Somehow, I created a loop so infinite, it made Doctor Strange look like an amateur. My CPU was screaming, my fan turned into a jet engine, and I watched Task Manager climb like a rocket to 99%.</p>

  <p>When I finally CTRL+C'd my way out, I just stared at the screen like it owed me money. All that, for a function that was supposed to print 3 items.</p>

  <p>Honestly? At least I learned that <code>while(true)</code> is not a suggestion — it’s a trap.</p>
  <p>10/10 would not recommend. Debug responsibly, friends.</p>
