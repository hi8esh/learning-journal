# Learning Journal

Welcome to my **Learning Journal** project! This is a personal blog-style web application where I document my coding journey, including the challenges, triumphs, and lessons I've learned along the way. This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to showcase my learning as I explore web development.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
- **Dynamic Blog Grid**: The homepage features a grid layout showcasing various blog posts, including a "View More Posts" button to reveal additional content.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript is used to reveal hidden posts on button click and auto-reveal posts based on screen size.
- **Personal Touch**: The "About Me" page highlights my journey into coding, including links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/hi8esh) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hi8esh).

## Demo
